          All of the planets in our solar system orbit around the Sun. Planets that orbit around other stars are called exoplanets.
All of the planets in our solar system orbit around the Sun. Planets that orbit around other stars are called exoplanets. Exoplanets are very hard to see directly with telescopes. They are hidden by the bright glare of the stars they orbit.

So, astronomers use other ways to detect and study these distant planets. They search for exoplanets by looking at the effects these planets have on the stars they orbit.

        <h2>
          How do we look for Exoplanets ?
        </h2>
        <p>
          One way to search for exoplanets is to look for "wobbly" stars. A star that has planets doesn’t orbit perfectly around its center. From far away, this off-center orbit makes the star look like it’s wobbling.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Example
        </h2>
        <img src="image/exoplanet d.gif">
        <p>
          An orbiting planet (small blue ball) causes a star (large yellow ball) to orbit slightly off-center. From a distance, this makes it look like the star is wobbling.
