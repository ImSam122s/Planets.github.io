        <h2>What is an Asteroid ?</h2>
        <p>
          Asteroids, sometimes called minor planets, are rocky, airless remnants
          left over from the early formation of our solar system about 4.6 billion years ago.
          The current known asteroid count is: 1,291,484.
          Most of this ancient space rubble can be found orbiting the Sun between Mars and Jupiter within the main
          asteroid belt. Asteroids range in size from Vesta – the largest at about 329 miles (530 kilometers) in
          diameter – to bodies that are less than 33 feet (10 meters) across. The total mass of all the asteroids
          combined is less than that of Earth's Moon.

        <p>
          What is asteroid Dimorphos?
        Dimorphos is a moonlet of Didymos, which is defined as a near-Earth asteroid and has a
        shape like a top spinning in space with a diameter of about a half mile (780 meters). Neither object
        imperils Earth.

        <h2>101955 Bennu</h2>
        <p>
          101955 Bennu is a carbonaceous asteroid in the Apollo group discovered by the
        LINEAR Project on 11 September 1999. It is a potentially hazardous object that
        is listed on the Sentry Risk Table and has the highest cumulative rating on the Palermo
        Technical Impact Hazard Scale.

      <h2>Vesta</h2>
      <p>
        Vesta is one of the largest objects in the asteroid belt, with a mean diameter
        of 525 kilometres. It was discovered by the German astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias
        Olbers on 29 March 1807 and is named after Vesta, the virgin goddess of home and hearth
        from Roman mythology.

      <h2>
        Asteroid Classifications
      </h2>
      <p>
        • Near-Earth Asteroids: These objects have orbits that pass close by that of Earth. Asteroids that actually cross Earth's
        orbital path are known as Earth-crossers.
      </p>
      <p>
        • Trojans: These asteroids share an orbit with a larger planet, but do not collide with it because they gather
        around two special places in the orbit (called the L4 and L5 Lagrangian points). There, the gravitational pull
        from the Sun and the planet are balanced by a trojan's tendency to otherwise fly out of orbit. The Jupiter trojans
        form the most significant population of trojan asteroids. It is thought that they are as numerous as the asteroids
        in the asteroid belt. There are Mars and Neptune trojans, and NASA announced the discovery of an Earth trojan in 2011.
      </p>
      <p>
        • Main Asteroid Belt: The majority of known asteroids orbit within the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter,
        generally with not very elongated orbits. The belt is estimated to contain between 1.1 and 1.9 million asteroids
        larger than 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) in diameter, and millions of smaller ones. Early in the history of the solar
        system, the gravity of newly formed Jupiter brought an end to the formation of planetary bodies in this region and
        caused the small bodies to collide with one another, fragmenting them into the asteroids we observe today.
      </p>
    
      <h2>
        Composition of an Asteroid
      </h2>
      <p>
        The three broad composition classes of asteroids are C-, S-, and M-types.
      </p>
      <p>
        • The C-type (chondrite) asteroids are most common. They probably consist of clay and
        silicate rocks, and are dark in appearance. They are among the most ancient objects in
        the solar system.
      </p>
      <p>
        • The S-types ("stony") are made up of silicate materials and nickel-iron.
      </p>
      <p>
        • The M-types are metallic (nickel-iron). The asteroids' compositional differences are
        related to how far from the Sun they formed. Some experienced high temperatures after
        they formed and partly melted, with iron sinking to the center and forcing basaltic (volcanic)
        lava to the surface.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        The orbits of asteroids can be changed by Jupiter's massive gravity – and by occasional close
        encounters with Mars or other objects. These encounters can knock asteroids out of the main belt,
        and hurl them into space in all directions across the orbits of the other planets. Stray asteroids
        and asteroid fragments have slammed into Earth and the other planets in the past, playing a major
        role in altering the geological history of the planets and in the evolution of life on Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scientists continuously monitor Earth-crossing asteroids, whose paths intersect Earth's orbit,
        and near-Earth asteroids that approach Earth's orbital distance to within about 28 million miles
        (45 million kilometers) and may pose an impact danger. Radar is a valuable tool in detecting and
        monitoring potential impact hazards. By reflecting transmitted signals off objects, images and other
        information can be derived from the echoes. Scientists can learn a great deal about an asteroid's orbit,
        rotation, size, shape, and metal concentration.
