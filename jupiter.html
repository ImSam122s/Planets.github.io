        <h2>Jupiter, the GIANT</h2>
        <p>
          Jupiter has a long history of surprising scientists – all the way back to 1610 when Galileo Galilei found the first
          moons beyond Earth. That discovery changed the way we see the universe.

          40-Year Study Finds Mysterious Patterns in Temperatures at Jupiter
          Fifth in line from the Sun, Jupiter is, by far, the largest planet in
          the solar system – more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined.

          upiter's familiar stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water,
          floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant
          storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.
          One spacecraft – NASA's Juno orbiter – is currently exploring this giant world.

          Size and Distance
        </h2>
        <p>
          Jupiter, with a radius of 43,440.7 miles (69,911 kilometers), is approximately 11 times larger
          in diameter than Earth. To put it in perspective, if Earth were scaled down to the size of a nickel,
          Jupiter would be as big as a basketball.
          In terms of its distance from the Sun, Jupiter is located about 484 million miles (778 million kilometers)
          away on average. This puts it at a distance of 5.2 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun. An astronomical unit is
          the average distance between the Earth and the Sun. From this distance, it takes approximately 43 minutes for sunlight
          to travel from the Sun to reach Jupiter.

            Moons of Jupiter
          </h2>
          <p>
            By most counts, Jupiter has between 80 and 95 moons, but neither number captures the complexity
            of the Jovian system of moons, rings and asteroids. The giant planet commands thousands of small
            objects in its orbit.
