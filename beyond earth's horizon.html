        <h2>Mercury</h2>
        <p>
          From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more
          than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth,
          and the sunlight would be as much as 11 times brighter.

        <p>
          Similar in structure and size to Earth, Venus's thick atmosphere
          traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest
          planet in our solar system.

        <p>
          Earth—our home planet—is the only place we know of so far that's
          inhabited by living things. It's also the only planet in our solar
          system with liquid water on the surface.

        <p>
          Mars is a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere.
          There is strong evidence Mars was billions of years ago wetter and
          warmer, with a thicker atmosphere.

          Jupiter is more than twice as massive than the other planets of our

          centuries-old storm bigger than Earth.

          Adorned with a dazzling, complex system of icy rings,
          Saturn is unique in our solar system. The other giant
          planets have rings, but none are as spectacular as Saturn's.

          Uranus—seventh planet from the Sun—rotates at a nearly
          90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit. This unique
          tilt makes Uranus appear to spin on its side.

          Neptune—the eighth and most distant major planet orbiting our

          Pluto is a complex world of ice mountains and frozen plains.

          of a new class of worlds called dwarf planets.

          <h2>What is a Black Hole?</h2>
          <p>
            A black hole is a region in space where gravity is so strong that
            nothing, not even light, can escape from it. It forms when a massive
            star collapses under its own weight, creating a gravitational pull that
            is incredibly powerful. It's like a cosmic vacuum cleaner that sucks in
            everything nearby, including matter and even light itself. Black holes
            are mysterious and fascinating objects in the universe.

            <p>
              A nebula is a vast cloud of gas and dust in outer space. It is often the
              birthplace of stars and can be illuminated by nearby stars or energetic processes.
              Nebulae come in various shapes and sizes, and they are fascinating objects of study in
              astronomy.

              <h2>What is an Exoplanet</h2>
              <p>
                All planets in our solar system revolve around the Sun, while planets orbiting other
                stars are known as exoplanets. Exoplanets are difficult to observe directly due to the intense
                brightness of their host stars.

                <h2>Asteroids</h2>
                <p>
                  In summary, an asteroid is a type of minor planet that orbits within the inner
                  Solar System. It is neither a planet nor a comet and lacks an atmosphere. Asteroids
                  can be composed of rock, metal, or ice, and they come in various sizes and shapes.
                  They can range from small 1-meter rocks to much larger bodies, with some reaching nearly
                  1000 km in diameter, qualifying as dwarf planets.
