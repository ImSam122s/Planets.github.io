        <h2>Pluto</h2>
        <p>
          Pluto is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt, a donut-shaped region of icy bodies beyond the orbit of
          Neptune. There may be millions of these icy objects, collectively referred to as Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs)
          or trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), in this distant region of our solar system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pluto – which is smaller than Earth’s Moon – has a heart-shaped glacier that’s the size of Texas and Oklahoma.
          This fascinating world has blue skies, spinning moons, mountains as high as the Rockies, and it snows – but the snow is red.
          On July 14, 2015, NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft made its historic flight through the Pluto system –
          providing the first close-up images of Pluto and its moons and collecting other data that has transformed our understanding
          of these mysterious worlds on the solar system’s outer frontier.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the years since that groundbreaking flyby, nearly every conjecture about Pluto possibly being an inert ball
          of ice has been thrown out the window or flipped on its head.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s clear to me that the solar system saved the best for last!” said Alan Stern,
          New Horizons principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute, Boulder, Colorado.
          “We could not have explored a more fascinating or scientifically important planet at the edge of our solar system.
          The New Horizons team worked for 15 years to plan and execute this flyby and Pluto paid us back in spades!
        </p>
        <h2>
          Surface
        </h2>
        <p>
          Pluto's surface is characterized by mountains, valleys, plains, and craters. The temperature
          on Pluto can be as cold as -375 to -400 degrees Fahrenheit (-226 to -240 degrees Celsius).
        </p>
        <p>
          Pluto's tallest mountains are 6,500 to 9,800 feet (2 to 3 kilometers) in height. The mountains are big blocks
          of water ice, sometimes with a coating of frozen gases like methane. Long troughs and valleys as long as 370 miles
          (600 kilometers) add to the interesting features of this faraway dwarf planet.
          Craters as large as 162 miles (260 kilometers) in diameter dot some of the landscape on Pluto, with some
          showing signs of erosion and filling. This suggests tectonic forces are slowly resurfacing Pluto.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most prominent plains observed on Pluto appear to be made of frozen nitrogen gas and show no craters.
          These plains do show structures suggesting convection (blobs of material circulating up and down).
        </p>
        <h2>
          Atmosphere
        </h2>
        <p>
          Pluto has a thin, tenuous atmosphere that expands when it comes closer to the Sun and collapses as it moves
          farther away – similar to a comet. The main constituent is molecular nitrogen, though molecules of methane and
          carbon monoxide have also been detected.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Pluto is close to the Sun, its surface ices sublimate (changing directly from solid to gas)
          and rise to temporarily form a thin atmosphere. Pluto's low gravity (about 6% of Earth's) causes the atmosphere
          to be much more extended in altitude than our planet's atmosphere.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pluto becomes much colder during the part of each year when it is traveling far away from the Sun.
          During this time, the bulk of the planet's atmosphere may freeze and fall as snow to the surface.
        </p>
