        <h2>Orion or MESSIER 42</h2>
        <p>
          Believed to be the cosmic fire of creation by the Maya of Mesoamerica, M42 blazes brightly in the constellation Orion. Popularly called the Orion Nebula, this stellar nursery has been known to many different cultures throughout human history. The nebula is only 1,500 light-years away, making it the closest large star-forming region to Earth and giving it a relatively bright apparent magnitude of 4. Because of its brightness and prominent location just below Orion’s belt, M42 can be spotted with the naked eye, while offering an excellent peek at stellar birth for those with telescopes. It is best observed during January.

The Mayan culture’s likening of the Orion Nebula to a cosmic fire of creation is very apt. The nebula is an enormous cloud of dust and gas where vast numbers of new stars are being forged. Its bright, central region is the home of four massive, young stars that shape the nebula. The four hefty stars are called the Trapezium because they are arranged in a trapezoidal pattern. Ultraviolet light unleashed by these stars is carving a cavity in the nebula and disrupting the growth of hundreds of smaller stars.

This stunning Hubble image offers the sharpest view of the Orion Nebula ever obtained. Created using 520 different Hubble exposures taken in multiple wavelengths of light, this mosaic contains over one billion pixels. Hubble imaged most of the nebula, but ground-based images were used to fill in the gaps in its observations. The orange color in the image can be attributed to hydrogen, green represents oxygen, and the red represents both sulfur and observations made in infrared light.

          Along with Venus, Earth, and Mars, Mercury is one of the rocky planets. It has a solid surface
          that is covered with craters like our Moon. It has a thin atmosphere, and it doesn't have any moons.
          Mercury likes to keep things simple.
          Mercury spins slowly compared to Earth, so one day lasts a long time. Mercury takes 59 Earth days to
          make one full rotation. But a year on Mercury goes fast. Because it's the closest planet to the sun,
          it goes around the Sun in just 88 Earth days.
        </p>
        <h2>10 Facts about Mercury</h2>
        <p>
          1 - A Small World: Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system
          only slightly larger than Earth's Moon.
        </p>
        <p>
          2 - INSIDE TRACK it is known by The Planet that Orbits the closest to the Sun.
        </p>
        <p>
          3 - FASTEST PLANET Mercury is the fastest planet in our solar system, traveling through
          space at
          nearly 29 miles (47 kilometers)
          per second. The closer a planet is to the Sun, the faster it
          travels. Since Mercury is the fastest planet and has
          the shortest distance to travel around the Sun, it has the shortest
          year of all the planets in our solar system
          88 days.
        </p>
        <p>
          4 - ROUGH SURFACE Mercury is a rocky planet, also known as a terrestrial planet.
          Mercury has a solid, cratered surface, much like the Earth's moon.
        </p>
        <p>
          5 - CAN'T BREATHE THERE
          Mercury's thin atmosphere, or exosphere, is composed mostly of oxygen
          (O2), sodium (Na), hydrogen (H2), helium (He), and potassium (K). 
        </p>
        <P>
          6 -MOONLESS
          Mercury has no moons. 
        </P>
        <p>
          7 - RINGLESS
          There are no rings around Mercury. 
        </p>
        <p>
          8 - TOUGH PLACE FOR LIFE
          It is unlikely that life as we know it could survive on Mercury due to solar
          radiation, and extreme temperatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          9 - BIG SUN
          Standing on Mercury's surface at its closest approach to the Sun, our star would
          appear more than three times larger than it does on Earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          10 - ROBOTIC VISITORS
          Two NASA missions have explored Mercury: Mariner 10 was the first to fly by Mercury,
          and MESSENGER was the first to orbit. ESA's BepiColombo is on its way to Mercury.

        <h2>
          Orbit and Rotations
        </h2>
        <p>
          Mercury's highly eccentric, egg-shaped orbit takes the planet as close as 29 million
          miles (47 million kilometers) and as far as 43 million miles (70 million kilometers)
          from the Sun. It speeds around the Sun every 88 days, traveling through space at nearly
          29 miles (47 kilometers) per second, faster than any other planet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mercury spins slowly on its axis and completes one rotation every 59 Earth days. But
          when Mercury is moving fastest in its elliptical orbit around the Sun (and it is closest
          to the Sun), each rotation is not accompanied by sunrise and sunset like it is on most other
          planets. The morning Sun appears to rise briefly, set, and rise again from some parts of the planet's
          surface. The same thing happens in reverse at sunset for other parts of the surface. One Mercury solar
          day (one full day-night cycle) equals 176 Earth days -  just over two years on Mercury.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mercury's axis of rotation is tilted just 2 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun.
          That means it spins nearly perfectly upright and so does not experience seasons as many other planets do.
