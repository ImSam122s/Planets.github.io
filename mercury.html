      <h2>Mercury</h2>
      <p>
        From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as
        large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter.
        Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system
        that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere.
        Because of Mercury's elliptical egg-shaped orbit, and sluggish rotation, the Sun appears to
        rise briefly, set, and rise again from some parts of the planet's surface. The same thing
        happens in reverse at sunset.
        Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system. It's a little bigger than Earth's Moon.
        It is the closest planet to the Sun, but it's actually not the hottest. Venus is hotter.
      </p>  
      <p>
        Along with Venus, Earth, and Mars, Mercury is one of the rocky planets. It has a solid surface
        that is covered with craters like our Moon. It has a thin atmosphere, and it doesn't have any moons.
        Mercury likes to keep things simple.
        Mercury spins slowly compared to Earth, so one day lasts a long time. Mercury takes 59 Earth days to
        make one full rotation. But a year on Mercury goes fast. Because it's the closest planet to the sun,
        it goes around the Sun in just 88 Earth days.
      </p>
      <h2>10 Facts about Mercury</h2>
      <p>
        1 - A Small World: Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system
        only slightly larger than Earth's Moon.
      </p>
      <p>
        2 - INSIDE TRACK it is known by The Planet that Orbits the closest to the Sun.
      </p>
      <p>
        3 - FASTEST PLANET Mercury is the fastest planet in our solar system, traveling through
        space at
        nearly 29 miles (47 kilometers)
        per second. The closer a planet is to the Sun, the faster it
        travels. Since Mercury is the fastest planet and has
        the shortest distance to travel around the Sun, it has the shortest
        year of all the planets in our solar system
        88 days.
      </p>
      <p>
        4 - ROUGH SURFACE Mercury is a rocky planet, also known as a terrestrial planet.
        Mercury has a solid, cratered surface, much like the Earth's moon.
      </p>
      <p>
        5 - CAN'T BREATHE THERE
        Mercury's thin atmosphere, or exosphere, is composed mostly of oxygen
        (O2), sodium (Na), hydrogen (H2), helium (He), and potassium (K). 
      </p>
      <P>
        6 -MOONLESS
        Mercury has no moons. 
      </P>
      <p>
        7 - RINGLESS
        There are no rings around Mercury. 
      </p>
      <p>
        8 - TOUGH PLACE FOR LIFE
        It is unlikely that life as we know it could survive on Mercury due to solar
        radiation, and extreme temperatures.
      </p>
      <p>
        9 - BIG SUN
        Standing on Mercury's surface at its closest approach to the Sun, our star would
        appear more than three times larger than it does on Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        10 - ROBOTIC VISITORS
        Two NASA missions have explored Mercury: Mariner 10 was the first to fly by Mercury,
        and MESSENGER was the first to orbit. ESA's BepiColombo is on its way to Mercury.
      </p>


      <h2>
        Orbit and Rotations
      </h2>
      <p>
        Mercury's highly eccentric, egg-shaped orbit takes the planet as close as 29 million
        miles (47 million kilometers) and as far as 43 million miles (70 million kilometers)
        from the Sun. It speeds around the Sun every 88 days, traveling through space at nearly
        29 miles (47 kilometers) per second, faster than any other planet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mercury spins slowly on its axis and completes one rotation every 59 Earth days. But
        when Mercury is moving fastest in its elliptical orbit around the Sun (and it is closest
        to the Sun), each rotation is not accompanied by sunrise and sunset like it is on most other
        planets. The morning Sun appears to rise briefly, set, and rise again from some parts of the planet's
        surface. The same thing happens in reverse at sunset for other parts of the surface. One Mercury solar
        day (one full day-night cycle) equals 176 Earth days -  just over two years on Mercury.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mercury's axis of rotation is tilted just 2 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun.
        That means it spins nearly perfectly upright and so does not experience seasons as many other planets do.
