        <h2>Earth, our home</h2>
        <p>
          Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know of so far thatâ€™s inhabited by living things.

          While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only
          world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface. Just slightly larger than nearby
          Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Earth is the only planet in the Solar System whose English name does not come from Greek or Roman mythology.
          The name was taken from Old English and Germanic. It simply means "the ground." There are, of course, many
          names for our planet in the thousands of languages spoken by the people of the third planet from the Sun.

        <h2>
          Potential for LIFE
        </h2>
        <p>
          Earth has a very hospitable temperature and mix of chemicals that have made life abundant here.
          Most notably, Earth is unique in that most of our planet is covered in liquid water, since the
          temperature allows liquid water to exist for extended periods of time. Earth's vast oceans provided
          a convenient place for life to begin about 3.8 billion years ago.
          Some of the features of our planet that make it great for sustaining life are changing due to
          the ongoing effects of climate change.

        <h2>
          Size and Distance
        </h2>
        <p>
          With a radius of 3,959 miles (6,371 kilometers), Earth is the biggest of the terrestrial
          planets and the fifth largest planet overall.
          From an average distance of 93 million miles (150 million kilometers), Earth is
          exactly one astronomical unit away from the Sun because one astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU),
          is the distance from the Sun to Earth. This unit provides an easy way to quickly compare planets'
          distances from the Sun.
          It takes about eight minutes for light from the Sun to reach our planet.

        <h2>Moon</h2>
        <p>
          The fifth largest moon in the solar system, Earth's moon is the only
          place beyond Earth where humans have set foot.
        </p>
        <p>
          The brightest and largest object in our night sky, the Moon makes Earth a more livable
          planet by moderating our home planet's wobble on its axis, leading to a relatively stable climate.
          It also causes tides, creating a rhythm that has guided humans for thousands of years. The Moon was
          likely formed after a Mars-sized body collided with Earth.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Moon's Formation
        </h2>
        <p>
          The prevailing theory regarding the origin of the Moon suggests that approximately 4.5 billion
          years ago, a celestial body of similar size to Mars collided with Earth. This violent impact caused a
          significant amount of debris to be ejected from both Earth and the colliding object. Over time, this debris
          gradually accumulated and eventually coalesced to form our Moon, which currently resides at a distance of
          approximately 239,000 miles (384,000 kilometers) from Earth.
          At its formation, the Moon was in a molten or liquid state, resembling a global "magma ocean."
          However, within a span of around 100 million years, a substantial portion of this molten material
          had solidified. The less-dense rocks within this global ocean began to float upwards, gradually
          forming the lunar crust. This process led to the crystallization and differentiation of the Moon's
          interior, with denser materials sinking towards the core and lighter materials rising to the surface.
          Overall, the leading theory regarding the Moon's origin proposes that it was created through a collision
          between Earth and a Mars-sized object, resulting in the accumulation of debris that eventually formed our natural
          satellite. Over time, the Moon's molten state solidified, and the less-dense rocks floated upwards,
          contributing to the formation of the lunar crust.
