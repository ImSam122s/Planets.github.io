          <h2>So, that is a Real Black Hole?</h2>
          <p>
            This is the first picture of a black hole.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using the Event Horizon Telescope, scientists obtained an image of the black hole
            at the center of the galaxy M87. (There is a supermassive black hole at the center of
            our galaxy — the Milky Way.)
            The black hole is outlined by emission from hot gas swirling around it under
            the influence of strong gravity near its event horizon.
            Though scientists had theorized they could image black holes by capturing their silhouettes against their glowing surroundings, the ability to image an object so distant still eluded them. A team formed to take on the challenge, creating a network of telescopes known as the Event Horizon Telescope, or the EHT. They set out to capture an image of a black hole by improving upon a technique that allows for the imaging of far-away objects, known as Very Long Baseline Interferometry, or VLBI.

Telescopes of all types are used to see distant objects. The larger the diameter, or aperture, of the telescope, the greater its ability to gather more light and the higher its resolution (or ability to image fine details). To see details in objects that are far away and appear small and dim from Earth, we need to gather as much light as possible with very high resolution, so we need to use a telescope with a large aperture.

That’s why the VLBI technique was essential to capturing the black hole image. VLBI works by creating an array of smaller telescopes that can be synchronized to focus on the same object at the same time and act as a giant virtual telescope. In some cases, the smaller telescopes are also an array of multiple telescopes. This technique has been used to track spacecraft and to image distant cosmic radio sources, such as quasars.

          <h2>
            How do black holes form?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Black holes are expected to form via two distinct channels. According to the first pathway, they are stellar corpses, so they form when massive stars die. Stars whose birth masses are above roughly 8 to 10 times mass of our sun, when they exhaust all their fuel — their hydrogen — they explode and die leaving behind a very compact dense object, a black hole. The resulting black hole that is left behind is referred to as a stellar mass black hole and its mass is of the order of a few times the mass of the sun. 

Not all stars leave behind black holes, stars with lower birth masses leave behind a neutron star or a white dwarf. Another way that black holes form is from the direct collapse of gas, a process that is expected to result in more massive black holes with a mass ranging from 1000 times the mass of the sun up to even 100,000 times the mass of the sun. This channel circumvents the formation of the traditional star, and is believed to operate in the early universe and produce more massive black hole seeds.

          <h2>
            Who discovered black holes?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Black holes were predicted as an exact mathematical solution to Einstein's equations. Einstein's equations describe the shape of space around matter. The theory of general relativity connects the geometry or shape of shape to the detailed distribution of matter. 

The black hole solution was found was by Karl Schwarzschild in 1915, and these regions — black holes — were found to distort space extremally and generate a puncture in the fabric of spacetime. It was unclear at the time if these corresponded to real objects in the universe. Over time, as other end products of stellar death were detected, namely, neutron stars seen as pulsars it became clear that black holes were real and ought to exist. The first detected black hole was Cygnus-X1.
