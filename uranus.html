        <h2>Uranus</h2>
        <p>
          Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, and has the third-largest diameter in our
          solar system. It was the first planet found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered
          in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel, although he originally thought it was either a comet or a star.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was two years later that the object was universally accepted as a new planet, in part because of
          observations by astronomer Johann Elert Bode. Herschel tried unsuccessfully to name his discovery Georgium
          Sidus after King George III. Instead, the scientific community accepted Bode's suggestion to name it Uranus,
          the Greek god of the sky, as suggested by Bode.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Surface
        </h2>
        <p>As an ice giant, Uranus doesn’t have a true surface. The planet is mostly swirling fluids. While a spacecraft
          would have nowhere to land on Uranus, it wouldn’t be able to fly through its atmosphere unscathed either.
          The extreme
          pressures and temperatures would destroy a metal spacecraft.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Magnetosphere
        </h2>
        <p>
          Uranus has an unusual, irregularly shaped magnetosphere. Magnetic fields are typically in alignment with a
          planet's rotation, but Uranus' magnetic field is tipped over: the magnetic axis is tilted nearly 60 degrees
          from the planet's axis of rotation, and is also offset from the center of the planet by one-third of the planet's radius.
          Auroras on Uranus are not in line with the poles (like they are on Earth, Jupiter, and Saturn)
          due to the lopsided magnetic field.
          The magnetosphere tail behind Uranus opposite the Sun extends into space for millions of
          miles. Its magnetic field lines are twisted by Uranus’ sideways rotation into a long corkscrew
          shape.
        </p>
