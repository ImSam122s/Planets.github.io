          <h2>• Stellar-Mass</h2>
          <p>
            When a star with more than eight times the Sun’s mass runs out of fuel, its core collapses,
            rebounds, and explodes as a supernova. What’s left behind depends on the star’s mass before the
            explosion. If it was near the threshold, it creates a city-sized, superdense neutron star. If it
            had around 20 times the Sun’s mass or more, the star’s core collapses into a stellar-mass black hole.
            The masses of these newly born objects can range from a few to hundreds of times the Sun’s mass, depending
            on star’s mass when the supernova began. Stellar-mass black holes can continue to gain mass through collisions
            with stars and other black holes.
            Nearly all the stellar-mass black holes observed so far have been found because they’re paired with stars. They likely
            originated as mismatched stars where the more massive one evolved rapidly into a black hole. In some cases, called X-ray
            binaries, the black hole pulls gas off the star into a disk that heats up enough to produce X-rays. Binaries have revealed
            around 50 suspected or confirmed stellar-mass black holes in the Milky Way, but scientists think there may be as many as
            100 million in our galaxy alone.
          </p>
          <h2>• Supermassive</h2>
          <p>
            Almost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its center.
            These monster objects have hundreds of thousands to billions of times the Sun’s mass, although some
            scientists place the lower boundary at tens of thousands.
          </p>
          <p>
            The one at the center of our galaxy, Sagittarius A* (pronounced ey-star), is 4 million times the mass
            of the Sun – relatively small compared to those found in some other galaxies. For example, the black hole
            at the center of galaxy Holmberg 15A holds at least 40 billion solar masses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scientists aren’t sure how these monster objects came to be.
            Observations of distant galaxies show that some supermassive black holes formed in the first
            billion years after the birth of the universe. It’s possible these black holes began with the
            collapse of supermassive stars in the early universe, which gave them a head start.
            While their origins are mysterious, scientists know supermassive black holes can grow by
            feeding on smaller objects, like their stellar-mass relatives and neutron stars. They can also
            merge with other supermassive black holes when galaxies collide.
          </p>
          <h2>• Intermediate-Mass</h2>
          <p>
            Scientists are puzzled by the size gap between stellar-mass and supermassive black holes.
          </p>
          <p>
            They think there should be a continuum of sizes because, over cosmic time, collisions between
            stellar-mass black holes should have created some intermediate-mass black holes. These should range
            from around one hundred to hundreds of thousands of times the Sun’s mass – or tens of thousands,
            depending on how supermassive black holes are defined. Scientists are actively hunting for examples
            of these so-called missing-link black holes. Numerous candidates have been identified but have proven
            difficult to confirm.
