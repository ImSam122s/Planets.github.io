        <h2>Venus</h2>
        <p>
          Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is Earth’s closest planetary neighbor. It’s one of the four inner, terrestrial (or rocky) planets, and it’s often called Earth’s twin because it’s similar in size and density. These are not identical twins, however – there are radical differences between the two worlds.
        </p>

        <p>
          Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and it’s perpetually shrouded in thick, yellowish clouds of sulfuric acid that trap heat, causing a runaway greenhouse effect. It’s the hottest planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun. Surface temperatures on Venus are about 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475 degrees Celsius) – hot enough to melt lead. The surface is a rusty color and it’s peppered with intensely crunched mountains and thousands of large volcanoes. Scientists think it’s possible some volcanoes are still active.
        </p>

        <p>
          Venus has crushing air pressure at its surface – more than 90 times that of Earth – similar to the pressure you'd encounter a mile below the ocean on Earth.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Size and Distance
        </h2>
        <p>
          Our nearness to Venus is a matter of perspective. The planet is nearly as big around as Earth – 7,521 miles (12,104 kilometers) across, versus 7,926 miles (12,756 kilometers) for Earth. From Earth, Venus is the brightest object in the night sky after our own Moon. The ancients, therefore, gave it great importance in their cultures, even thinking it was two objects: a morning star and an evening star. That’s where the trick of perspective comes in.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because Venus’ orbit is closer to the Sun than ours, the two of them – from our viewpoint – never stray far from each other. The ancient Egyptians and Greeks saw Venus in two guises: first in one orbital position (seen in the morning), then another (your “evening” Venus), just at different times of the year.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Formation and Structure
        </h2>
        <p>
          Scientists searching for life beyond Earth are intrigued by the question of how habitable planets come into existence. The comparison between early Venus and Earth, despite their divergent paths, offers valuable insights into planet formation. Both planets share similarities in size, interior structure, and the presence of ancient oceans. However, while Earth teems with life, Venus has become a scorching inferno. The factors responsible for their disparate destinies likely originated in the swirling disk of gas and dust from which they were born around 4.6 billion years ago.

Studying the formation history of Venus can shed light on Earth's development and that of rocky planets orbiting other stars. If Venus and Earth were split in half and placed side by side, their similarities would be striking. Each planet possesses an iron core surrounded by a hot-rock mantle, with a rocky crust forming the outermost layer. Both planets experience changes in their surface due to the interaction of heat and pressure, leading to volcanic activity.

Further investigations are needed to uncover additional similarities between the two planets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exploring Venus, a planet that has been extensively studied by Earth's probes in orbit and briefly on its surface, may provide crucial information. Plate tectonics, the process by which the Earth's continents slowly move and reshape its surface, might have also occurred on Venus in its early history. Subduction, the sliding of one continental "plate" beneath another, is thought to be a key element in initiating plate tectonics and could be active on Venus today, potentially triggering volcanic activity.

NASA's Magellan spacecraft, which conducted a five-year mission to Venus until 1994, used radar mapping to reveal the planet's seething surface. The orbiter observed a relatively young and geologically active landscape, marked by extensive volcanic activity and towering mountain chains.

Understanding the differences between Venus and Earth and unraveling the mysteries of Venus's formation can enhance our knowledge of Earth's history and aid in comprehending the formation processes of rocky planets elsewhere in the universe.
