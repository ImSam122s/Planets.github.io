        <h2>Mars</h2>
        <p>
          ​Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun – a dusty, cold,
          desert world with a very thin atmosphere. Mars is also a
          dynamic planet with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct
          volcanoes, and evidence that it was even more active in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and
          it's the only planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien landscape.
          NASA currently has two rovers (Curiosity and Perseverance), one lander
          (InSight), and one helicopter (Ingenuity) exploring the surface of Mars.

        <h2>Phobos</h2>
        <p>
          Phobos, the innermost and larger moon, is heavily cratered, with deep
          grooves on its surface. It is slowly moving towards Mars and will crash
          into the planet or break apart in about 50 million years.
          Phobos was discovered by astronomer Asaph Hall on 18 August 1877 at the United States Naval
          Observatory in Washington, D.C., at about 09:14 Greenwich Mean Time. (Contemporary sources,
          using the pre-1925 astronomical convention that began the day at noon, give the time of discovery
          as 17 August at 16:06 Washington mean time, meaning 18 August 04:06 in the modern convention.)
          Hall had discovered Deimos, Mars's other moon, a few days earlier on 12 August 1877 at about 07:48 UTC.
          The names, originally spelled Phobus and Deimus respectively, were suggested by Henry Madan (1838–1901),
          science master at Eton College, based on Greek mythology, in which Phobos is a companion to the god, Ares.

      <h2>Deimos</h2>
      <p>
        Deimos is about half as big as Phobos and orbits two and a half times farther
        away from Mars. Oddly-shaped Deimos is covered in loose dirt that often fills
        the craters on its surface, making it appear smoother than pockmarked Phobos.
        In spite of its tiny gravity, only about a thousandth that of Earth, Deimos has retained considerable
        amounts of fine regolith (unconsolidated rocky debris) on its surface. It thus appears smoother than Phobos
        because its craters lie partially buried under this loose material. The largest crater, located near the satellite’s
        south pole, is about 2.5 km (1.6 miles) wide. The surface of Deimos is gray and very dark; its reflectance is only 7
        percent—about half that of the Moon’s surface. This fact and the satellite’s low mean density (about 1.5 grams per cubic centimetre)
        indicate a carbonaceous composition and suggest that Deimos may be a captured asteroid-like object.

        Mars surface
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Red Planet is actually many colors. At the surface, we see colors such as brown, gold, and tan.
        The reason Mars looks reddish is due to oxidization – or rusting – of iron in the rocks, regolith (Martian “soil”),
        and dust of Mars. This dust gets kicked up into the atmosphere and from a distance makes the planet appear mostly red.
        Interestingly, while Mars is about half the diameter of Earth, its surface has nearly the same area as Earth’s dry land.
        Its volcanoes, impact craters, crustal movement, and atmospheric conditions such as dust storms have altered the landscape
        of Mars over many years, creating some of the solar system's most interesting topographical features.
        A large canyon system called Valles Marineris is long enough to stretch from California to New York – more than 3,000 miles
        (4,800 kilometers). This Martian canyon is 200 miles (320 kilometers) at its widest and 4.3 miles (7 kilometers) at its deepest.
        That's about 10 times the size of Earth's Grand Canyon.
